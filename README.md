# Art-Price-Prediction-and-Cleaning
In the project I am revisiting an old Kaggle competition from my grad school professor. The data here is extremely messy so I focus on data cleaning, manipulation, and feature engineering for model building. I look at what variables are important when predicting the price of art.

Something to note, since the data had about 96,000 rows, it took some time to run the models and correctly build them efficiently. While, I did not get the complete best scores I wanted in metrics like RMSE and R-squared, I'm still satisfied with the outcome of the project... for now. I may revisit this in the future. 

Overall, this is a great example of cleaning messy data and figuring out how to shape into a tidy format to run some statistical analysis and build predictive models.
